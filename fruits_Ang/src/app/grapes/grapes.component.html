      <p><a class="my-first-letter">G</a>rapes are a type of fruit that grow in clusters of 15 to 300, and can be crimson, black, dark blue, yellow, green, orange, and pink. "White" grapes are actually green in color,
        and are evolutionarily derived from the purple grape. Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the color of purple grapes.[8]
        Anthocyanins and other pigment chemicals of the larger family of polyphenols in purple grapes are responsible for the varying shades of purple in red wines.[9][10] Grapes are typically an ellipsoid shape
        resembling a prolate spheroid.</p>

      <p><a class="my-first-letter">T</a>he cultivation of the domesticated grape began 6,000–8,000 years ago in the Near East.[1] Yeast, one of the earliest domesticated microorganisms, occurs naturally on the skins of grapes,
        leading to the discovery of alcoholic drinks such as wine. The earliest archeological evidence for a dominant position of wine-making in human culture dates from 8,000 years ago in Georgia.[2][3][4]
        The oldest known winery was found in Armenia, dating to around 4000 BC.[5] </p>
      <p><a class="my-first-letter">B</a>y the 9th century AD the city of Shiraz was known to produce some of the finest wines in the Middle East. Thus it has been proposed
        that Syrah red wine is named after Shiraz, a city in Persia where the grape was used to make Shirazi wine.[6] Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics record the cultivation of purple grapes, and history attests to the
        ancient Greeks, Phoenicians, and Romans growing purple grapes for both eating and wine production.[7] The growing of grapes would later spread to other regions in Europe, as well as North Africa, and eventually
        in North America.</p>

      <p><a class="my-first-letter">I</a>n the Bible, grapes are first mentioned when Noah grows them on his farm.[43] Instructions concerning wine are given in the book of Proverbs and in the book of Isaiah.[44][45] Deuteronomy tells of the use of wine
        during Jewish feasts. Grapes were also significant to both the Greeks and Romans, and their god of agriculture, Dionysus, was linked to grapes and wine, being frequently portrayed with grape leaves on his head.[46]
        Grapes are especially significant for Christians, who since the Early Church have used wine in their celebration of the Eucharist.[47] Views on the significance of the wine vary between denominations. In Christian art,
        grapes often represent the blood of Christ, such as the grape leaves in Caravaggio’s John the Baptist.</p>

  <h1>Grapes Agriculture</h1>
  <p>According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 75,866 square kilometers of the world are dedicated to grapes.
    Approximately 71% of world grape production is used for wine, 27% as fresh fruit, and 2% as dried fruit.</p>
