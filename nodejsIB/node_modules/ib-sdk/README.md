# Interactive Brokers SDK

Interactive Brokers SDK is a high-level object model build atop the [native javascript API](https://github.com/pilwon/node-ib).  It is all about straightforward programmatic access to your portfolio and market data subscriptions.  This is an open source project unrelated to Interactive Brokers.

#### Prerequisites

* An [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/) trading account.
* Install the [IB Gateway](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=16457) or [IB TWS (Trader Workstation)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=674&ns=T).

#### How It Works

The [IB Gateway](http://interactivebrokers.github.io) and [IB TWS (Trader Workstation)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=674&ns=T) software are graphical Java processes that encrypt and proxy calls to back-end servers.  Without dedicated communication infrastructure, there is no IB support for direct connections to their server tier.

The SDK uses the [native javascript API](https://github.com/pilwon/node-ib) to manage a TCP socket connection from Node.js to an IB Gateway or TWS instance.

## Installation

    npm install ib-sdk

## Getting Started

Login to the [IB Gateway](http://interactivebrokers.github.io) or [IB TWS (Trader Workstation)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=674&ns=T) software.

* The SDK expects to connect to an authenticated user session.
* The IB software must be configured to accept API connections.
* The SDK connects over `tcp://localhost:4001` by default.
* Use [ib-controller](https://github.com/ib-controller/ib-controller/releases) to automate UI interaction if necessary.

The main interface of the SDK is the `session` object returned by the `sdk.open` method callback.

```javascript
require("ib-sdk").open({
    host: "localhost",
    port: 4001,
    clientId: 0
}, (err, session) => {
    if (err) console.log(err);
    else session.close();
});
```

Invoke `session.close()` to trigger disconnect logic.

## Use Cases

Each `session` is associated with one or more accounts.  The most common case is access to a single [account](./example/account.js).  Other use cases can benefit from the lightweight [account summary](./example/summary.js) model.

Use the SDK's [symbol](./doc/symbols.md) syntax to create [security](./example/security.js) objects from which you can access market data and initiate [orders](./doc/orders.md).

Manage [system](./example/system.js) events like changes in market data farm connectivity, IB bulletins, and FYI's.  If you connect to the graphical TWS software, you can interact with display groups.

This package uses [Sugar](https://sugarjs.com) in extended mode, which modifies javascript prototypes.

The [service](./doc/service.md) module makes interacting with the IB API pub/sub paradigm easier and enables [remoting](./doc/remoting.md) from other processes or the browser.
